      Work is very important in our lives, but do you think we should work all the time without having rest and entertainment? 
      The answer is that we cannot go on working without stopping, from time to time and at regular intervals, to have some rest and some recreation.

      If we did not stop to rest, we could make mistakes, and the quality of our work might get worse. An overworked person may end up by losing the ability to think clearly and having no energy to continue working. Sleep is one of the ways in which nature renews our energy.
      
      <br><br>  <!-- فاصل بين القطع -->
      
      We should not waste our weekends. They should be made full use of and spent in the open. Having forgotten all about our work and the worries of life, we can then enjoy ourselves to the full and return the next day to work, our energy fully renewed.
